## Usage

### Basic Usage

This is a simple HTML code that creates a simple slideshow using only CSS. The slideshow contains five images, and when clicked, the user navigates to the corresponding image. The first part contains the controls of the slideshow, which include previews of the images, while the second part contains the slideshow itself, where the images are displayed. The slideshow can be easily customized by editing the CSS stylesheet, allowing the user to integrate it into their own website.

### Color variables
